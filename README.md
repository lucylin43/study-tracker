Study-tracker
=======================
Study-tracker is a web application for students to make dynamic To-Do lists for studying purposes. The application sets up a RESTful Node API using the Express framework and stores tasks in a local MongoDB database using Mongoose. 

AngularJS templating is used to implement a single-page web application, with Angular routing enabling navigation between different views without page refreshes.

### Usage
